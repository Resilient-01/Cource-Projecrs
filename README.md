# Cource-Projects


The goal of is to implement the following for MNIST digit classification. 
      
      1.	Implement a fully connected neural network with one hidden layer in keras/tensorflow. Number of neurons in the hidden layer to 100. 
      
      2.	Implement a deep neural network that has 10 hidden layers and each layer has 10 neurons.
      
      3.	Another program which will assess the quality of the features generated by the 10 layer deep net (in item 2) in its different layers.
